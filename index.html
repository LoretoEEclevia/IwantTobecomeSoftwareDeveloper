                <h3>Products of Spielbound</h3>
                <p>
                    The main thing that Spielbound sells is access to it one of a kind library of games. This access obtained 
                    by buying either a five-dollar day pass which gives access to the library for a full day or through monthly 
                    or annual memberships. This library is the largest in North America and is entirely searchable online to
                     find an exact game a customer may be looking for. In addition to access to their game library Spielbound 
                     offers room reservations from a ten-person room to renting out the entire store. They have hosted 
                     everything from cooperate events, to family gatherings, to wedding receptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spielbound also sells boardgames for use at home. While the selection of games to purchase is much 
                    smaller than what is in their library there is still plenty to chose from. Spielbound can even
                    specially order games for their customers that may not be available in their or other stores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spielbound's atmosphere would not be complete however without the café part of the business. Spielbound 
                    is a full-service coffee shop that servers locally roasted coffee and many different formats. They 
                    also have a menu of specialty game themed drinks that are unique to their store. In addition to the 
                    coffee, they sell beer, wine, cocktails, and a large variety of snacks. They do allow outside food and 
                    frequently have food deliveries straight to the café.
